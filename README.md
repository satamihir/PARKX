# Parkx
A fully Automated Parking System with the use of Arduino UNO 3 ,ESP8266 and displaying data on Webpage

ParkX

Problem Statement:
The problem which exists in parking systems currently in Rajkot is 
•	Time for searching a parking slot
•	Fuel consumption per search per person per day
•	Money gets complementary with fuel.

Existing solutions:
The current parking systems are not digitalized and hence the problem there is the same as above.

The solution suggested by ParkX :

1.	The Balloon -Strand model 
This model uses all the natural remedies and basic physics phenomena’s to deal with the problem of searching in the parking systems,
Say a person who is looking for parking wastes 500 metres of his fuel in looking for a slot, approximately 15000 km a month, in a country of 1.25 million people where approximately 62.5 million people use vehicles , roughly 9 billion kilo metres of distance is covered in just searching for parking in a month ,hence there has to be a solution for quick search for parking area .
Our balloon strand model uses a cotton fabrics inside which helium gas is filled, ofcourse which is abundant in nature and also it is a noble gas . This balloon automatically can fly high but if a strand is tied to its knot it can be upright to a specific height and this balloon can be seen from a far off distance . this same idea or basic physical phenomena is being used in our static model . 

The balloon can be seen to the people and hence they can find a slot without much chaos or wastage of fuel and time . gradually as the car places or parks itself on the strand the balloon is no more seen and is hidden behind the car which shows that the area is parked, whereas the rest of balloons in the air can be seen .this is the most sustainable approach to the problem of parking which exists not only in Rajkot but also in India .

Think?
Many people have a basic query of , is this idea feasible , or can it override the difficulties of natural disasters , but we are pleased to inform you all readers that this idea is being run in South Korea and is excellently working . This mechanisms is saving lectricity using no sensors yet giving wonderful results .

Problem or demerits :
Like every where this approach also has constraints , in multilevel parking sysems this mechchanism would not work hence we have brought you another easy and cheap solution , 

2.	Ultra-sonic sensor based web application cuym device 
It uses a Arduino for coding the hardware , in this model we have used ultrasonic sensors which has a transmitter to transmit sound waves and when it comes in contact with the car it shows “parked in the digital metre”., the web API further shows the slots for parking graphically and marks “red” for parked and green for “free”.

Hence this is nothing but digitally shows the whole parking slots . 

Benefits :

1.Saving million litres of fuel 
2.Time for search and money .

How does this technically work?
This code can only be run in chrome as it uses chrome extension that has been made by our team.This extension virally injects the ouput from iframe to the desired web page.We have used iframe to get the output of the arduino in a page with the IP address given dynamically by the arduino and have trasferred the output to the main parking slot page(index.html).
(Note: This concept has been used because iframe cannot directly be called through id from parent class,only message passing can been done through forced injection of message in the page.

We have also uploaded images and videos for the output!Happy learning!
